## IDEA
Tired to lose all my shortcuts (aliases) to my fav websites everytime I use a different computer or browser, I have decided to create
this simple web app. However the main driver is to learn ruby, git, sinatra, datamapper and oauth.

This app is not ready for public consumption, and please do not rate my dev skills based on this code.

## TODO
Please clean this code, it is embarrassing.

## BUGS
-b1 = when user is authenticated, if not private aliases have been created, the list of available aliases is empty.
